The melodious hum of the river is complemented by the distant chirping of the birds. Thick trees shield the guest house from the rest of the world, creating a sense of isolation. Inside, a warm, golden glow emanates from lanterns, illuminating the tavern section where a tavernkeeper is serving drinks. At a dimly lit corner, a mysterious stranger cloaked in shadows observes silently.",
